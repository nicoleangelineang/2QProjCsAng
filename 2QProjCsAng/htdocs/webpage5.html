                <h2>Visual Art</h2>
                <p style="color:white; margin: 10px 20px;">Visual Art is usually mistaken for the only type of NFT to exist, especially because its transaction mirrors 
                    that of the traditional art collecting that art enthusiants do through museums and exhibits, and while it is, indeed, the most common type that exists on the market,
                    it is only one of the many. As of currently, the three most valuable NFT tokens are of the type visual art, and there are hundreds more being sold every day, making
                    it a very promising market for visual artists.<br><br>

                    <p style="font-size: 17px;color: white;padding: 10px;"> "Everydays: the First 5000 Days" is a digital work by Beeple that ended up being sold to one artist for a price of $69,346,250. Specifically, it is a 
                        collection of 5,000 digital artworks that Beeple made in a span of 5,000 days (one each day), stitched together with recurring themes - both the light and happy, as well as the dark illustrations - 
                        into one big collage. According to Beeple, the progression of the artworks reveal his growth as an artist.

                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px 20px;">Music and Audio as NFTs are still a relatively new domain that is being explored by musicians and artists,
                    but because of the success of artists like Steve Aoki and Grimes, its market has been on a steady growth throughout the last year. Its main advantage for musicians is that, while they are
                    usually unable to earn 100% of the profit for traditional marketplaces due to record labels and contracts, they are able to do this in NFTs because of its nature.  <br><br>

                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px 20px;"> The gaming industry is one of the biggest industries now in this modern age, and since its expansion 
                    to the NFT marketplace, in-game collectibles (specifically, their ownership records) such as models, skins  and in-game currency can be bought by and for interested buyers. 
                    Some companies also offer limited editions, giving its playerbase more incentive to buy a limited file of an already limited asset.
                    And with majority of the profitable games being digital, game developers can easily jump on the bandwagon and grow their in-game collectible demand and economy. <br><br>
