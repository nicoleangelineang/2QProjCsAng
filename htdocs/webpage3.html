                    A few decades ago, the idea of combining digital media with thousands - millions! - 
                    of dollars through a digital-based currency and blockchain would be sure to earn you a few 
                    incredulous looks. However, fast forward to the future, the exact thing that was once impossible 
                    is now currently one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets to date. Now, as NFTs are growing more 
                    and more profitable by the day, we ought to revisit the road in which it went through to grow and 
                    boom into the market it is today.

                    <h5 style="font-size:2vw; color:lightseagreen; text-align:left;">Creation of the BlockChain technology</h5>
                    <p>In 1992, the concept of Blockchain was first proposed by Cryptographer David Chaum as a research product in order
                        to solve the security and transparency problems of the then-Bitcoin that was still in developement. However, it only came to completion 
                        and became the first decentralized system of transactions through the improvement of the design done by Satoshi Nakamoto in late 2008.

                    <h5 style="font-size:2vw; color:lightseagreen; text-align:left;">Creation of Cryptocurrency</h5>
                    <p>Along with the establishment of Blockchain Technology, Satoshi Nakamoto also created the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, using this technology. Before this, David Chaum 
                        also was the first to propose a cryptographic electronic currency called ecash in 1983, which was then improved by Wei Dai into "b-money" in 1998, then Nick Szabo into "bit gold" as a system that required a decentralized technology to complete proof of transaction cryptographically put otgether and published. Satoshi Nakamoto's 
                        is the version we see today.

                <h4>2013 The Introduction of "Colored Coins" </h4>

                    <h5 style="font-size:2vw; color:lightseagreen; text-align:center;">Colored Coins are said to be the very first NFTs to exist</h5>
                    <p>Colored coins during their release , first mentioned by Yoni Assia, were small tokens akin to bitcoin and could represent assets, media, and other digital receipts such as tokens, collectibles, shares, investments, etc. 
                        This was the project that pioneered the concept of NFTs as digitalized assets through a decentralized currency. This concept was later developed further in a paper by Yoni Assia, Lior Hakim, Vitalik Buterin, and Meni Resonefeld 
                        titled "Colored Coins - BitcoinX".</p><br>

                    <p>However, the system had a lot of flaws, and one of them was that, at that time, it did not have a stable value and its worth was measured by the people, not the market, which ultimately lead to its failure. However, it is undeniable that this was 
                        the definite start of the rise of NFTs in the then-developing world.

                <h4>2015 CounterParty</h4>
                <p>CounterParty, a financial platform based on an open-source metacoin-type protocol which provided features for decentralized currency transactions, was created in 2014. It was specifically made for 
                    Bitcoin transactions but, added in 2014, Ethereum also became supported by the platform (which is currently the main currency for NFTs)

                    <h5 style="font-size:2vw; color:lightseagreen; text-align:left;">In-game assets and collectibles on CounterParty</h5>

                    <p> Spells of Genesis and Force of Will were issued on the platform on April 2015 and August 2016, respectively, and they were the prioneers of in-game assets being
                        purchaseable by cryptocurrencies - in this case, Etherium. <br><br>

                        <img src="https://www.fowsystem.com/de/Images/B/CTohhYpYbjQFJfccWV0Q==/files/Alice.png" width="25%" style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; top:50px;">
                        Specifically, Spells of Genesis was the first to coin the idea of issuing in-game collectibles through a Blockchain to its playerbase, 
                        as well as the first to launch an in-game currency that would be used to buy it. Then, this idea was later further developed by the game developers 
                        of Force of Will, a very popular trading card game, as they then started to use CounterParty to launch their cards to be traded through a blockchain, allowing its big audience to 
                        join the world of cryptocurrency in order to acquire these limited-edition in-game assets. 
                        <br><br>
                        As of now, both of these games are at the forefront of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based games.

                    <p> After in-game assets became blockchain-based transactions in Counterparty, memes then soon followed. Specifically, Rare Pepes - memes 
                        based off of the character Pepe the Frog - started appearing on the platform as assets that you could buy using bitcoin. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Then, around March of 2017, Ethereum rose to mainstream and these Rare Pepe memes started appearing outside of the platform, as well. One particular 
                        event was the creation of "Peperium", a project that aimed to be a "decentralized meme marketplace that allowed transactions only using IPFS and Ethereum with the tokens "RARE" as the primary currency".

                <h4>CryptoPunks</h4>
                
                <p>Then, in June of 2017, the CryptoPunks project was created with the concepts stockpiled throughout the years. The project mirrors that of present NFT marketplaces 
                    wherein unique characters (specifically in "punk" themes) are mass AI-generated (10,000 and more) with different characteristics each and are then sold to interested buyers for certain prices, whether through a set price 
                    or through bidding. The transactions and payments were done through the client's Ethereum wallet issued through a blockchain.

                <p>Afterwards, following the moderate success of CryptoPunks was CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based virtual game that had the typical controls for animal games such as adopting and raising animals, but more importanty, players could trade.
                    Specifically, players were able to trade these unique mass AI-generated kitties through a blockchain using entirely Ethereum. The most profit ever earned from a single digital kitten is 
                    the owner of Founder Cat #40 who earned $1,064,023.00 and of Founder Cat #17 who earned $837,031.00.
                    <br><br>
                    And while people did not fully understand why so many were spending thousands of dollars on digital kittens, it was no doubt 
                    the start of the rise and boom of NFTs.

                <h4>The Rise and Boom of NFTs</h4>
            
                <p>Then, definitely, the rest was history.<br><br>

                The period between 2019-2021 leading up to 2022 was when NFTs really blew up and became a well-known market not just in the cryptocurrency world, but also in art, gaming, and even music circles. From one platform - Counterparty - 
                it grew to over 50 platforms such as OpenSea and SuperRare, them being the leading markets.
                And while this growth can be attributed to the surrounding controversy about its carbon footprint and energy consumption, it can also be due to the interest of famous celebrities and their NFT purchases 
                that set the public eye on NFTs even more than before. Some celebrities known to have bought NFTS are Snoop Dogg, Travis Barker, and Justin Beiber, while some even celebrities went above and beyond and started selling them, as well, 
                such as Steve Aoki, Grimes, and Shawn Mendes. <br><br>

                Additionally, with large establishments and platforms promoting it such as the controversial Twitter hexagons display photos, the Miss Universe Association's involvement with NFTs, and the continued growth of 
                Ethereum marketplaces, NFTs have just gotten bigger and bigger, despite all the hate surrounding it. </p>
