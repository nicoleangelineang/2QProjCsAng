                    In this world and age, it’s hard to keep up with trends when everything has gone too 
                    high technology for the majority. This also means that, by extension, the creations 
                    and their purposes have begun to become more and more hard to understand. NFTs are an 
                    example of these, and because of the explosion of blockchain technology, it’s become 
                    bigger than ever and people need to start understanding what it is to become more 
                    aware of the world today. <br><br> <div>So, what is an NFT? And what’s all the hype on it about? </div><br>

                    of assets like collectibles - cards, rarities, etc. with unique identification codes and metadata 
                    that allow them to be unique from all other tokens. <br><br>

                <hr>
                    However, the token itself is not a cryptocurrency, because they cannot be traded or exchanged for commercial transactions. 
                    Additionally, they are extensible, meaning that multiple NFTs can be combined to create 
                    a third NFT that is just as unique.

                NFTs, and most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and etc. use the blockchain technology. It is especially important because blockchain operates with no one in charge - that is, 
                it allowed a decentralized cryptocurrency where owners were unable to alter their client’s currencies and files unlike before where clients had to merely trust the creators to 
                not tamper with it. <br>
